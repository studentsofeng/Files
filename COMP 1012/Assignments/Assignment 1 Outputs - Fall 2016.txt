ASSIGNMENT 1: BASIC CALCULATIONS

CALORIE CONTENT OF THE COATING ON A DOUGHNUT

CONSTANTS
  Conversion:             1 cm = 10 mm
  Conversion:             1 L  = 1000 cm^3
  Conversion:             1 kg = 1000 g

DOUGHNUT DIMENSIONS
  Diameter with coating        =  11.0 cm
  Height, coating on top only  =   4.1 cm
  Radius a of tube, no coating =   2.0 cm
  Radius c to centre of tube   =   3.4 cm
  Volume without coating       = 268.5 cm^3
  Volume with coating all over = 296.0 cm^3
  Volume of half coating       =  13.8 cm^3
  Coating density              =  1.36 kg/L
  Mass of half coating         =  18.7 g
  Calorie content of sugar     =  3.04 Cal/g
  Calorie content of coating   =    57 Cal
