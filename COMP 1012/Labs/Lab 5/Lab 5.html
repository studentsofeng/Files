        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an

      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.
      </p>


      <h2>Exercise 1: Printing shapes.</h2>
      <p> 
        In this exercise you will write a Python script that will print out
        several different shapes. In each case, create the shape row by row,
        using one <span class="codeword">for</span> loop to advance the rows,
        and one or more <span class="codeword">for</span> loops to add the
        characters in a row to the end of the current string. <em>Make your
        code work for several different sizes,</em> including the one
        specified in each case. Since this is an exercise in using nested 
        <span class="codeword">for</span> loops, you are <em>not allowed</em>
        to use <span class="codeword">5*'X'</span> nor any 
        <span class="codeword">if</span> statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the figures to print:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <strong>An empty square of size 8 using "*" :</strong>
          <div class="output">
A HOLLOW SQUARE OF SIZE 8
    
    
********
*      *
*      *
*      *
*      *
*      *
*      *
********
          </div>
          <div class="aside">
            Hmmm... It doesn't look much like a square, does
            it? The space allocated to each character in this font is actually
            rectangular, so an <em>n</em>Ã—<em>n</em> array of characters is
            rectangular rather than square. To make the exercise more
            challenging, you could figure out a correction factor by which you
            multiply the width to make your designs look more like squares. But
            first try these exercises without this complication. 
          </div>
          <p>
            Here's an example of the code to produce this square (without any
            corrections to make it look more square). The variable 
            <span class="codeword">row</span>
            is assigned the number of each row, but it is not actually used for
            anything. It is basically a counter. Note how all the characters to
            print a row of the the hollow square are held by a string variable 
            <span class="codeword">text</span>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll have to figure out the rest of the examples for yourself.

      <h2>Exercise 2: Defining a function to print a shape.</h2>
      <p>
        The essence of programming is to write code that can solve problems
        where you don't know all the details in advance. Once your code gets the
        details, it should be able to come up with an answer by adjusting
        automatically to those details. We often code this self-adjusting code
        in a <em>function</em> with <em>parameters</em>. When other
        code calls the function, that code must provide <em>arguments</em>,
        which are values that are matched one-by-one to the corresponding
        parameters. The arguments provide the missing details, and the function
        solves the problem that is now fully specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following function will draw a hollow square of a
        specified size, using whatever character you want. Copy the code from
        this webpage and paste it into Anaconda to create the function. A call to
        <span class="codeword">drawSquare(8,'*')</span> should produce the same
        results as the example above. Try it for several sizes, including 0, 1,
        2, and 3. Can you figure out how it handles these small cases, when the
        code has three <span class="codeword">for</span> loops, and looks like
        it should always print at least three rows? What happens when you pass
        an argument with several characters as the second argument? How would
        you fix it?
      </p>
      <div class="code">
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="definition">drawSquare</span>(SIZE, CHAR) :
    <span class="comment"># top row is solid</span>
    <span class="keyword">for</span> row <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="literal">1</span>) :
        text = <span class="string">""</span>
        <span class="keyword">for</span> col <span class="keyword">in</span> range(SIZE) :
            text += CHAR
        <span class="builtin">print</span> (text)
    <span class="comment"># middle rows have a left character, blanks, and right character</span>
    <span class="keyword">for</span> row <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="literal">1</span>, SIZE - <span class="literal">1</span>) :
        text = CHAR
        <span class="keyword">for</span> col <span class="keyword">in</span> range(SIZE - <span class="literal">2</span>) :
            text += <span class="string">' '</span>
        text += CHAR
        <span class="builtin">print</span> (text)
    <span class="comment"># bottom row is solid</span>
    <span class="keyword">for</span> row <span class="keyword">in</span> range(max(SIZE - <span class="literal">1</span>, <span class="literal">1</span>), SIZE) :
        text = <span class="string">""</span>
        <span class="keyword">for</span> col <span class="keyword">in</span> range(SIZE) :
            text += CHAR
        <span class="builtin">print</span> (text)
      </div>

      <p>
        Figure out how to write a function to draw the following example. Put
        the function definition in a file that you can run. Running the file
        creates the function. You can then call it from the command line. Try
        calling your function with different argument values, including the ones
        specified.

        <li> 
          <strong>A backslash-square of size 10 with "\" :</strong>
          <p>
            Output a solid square with a blank <span class="codeword">'\'</span>
            running through it, using the dimension 10 and character '\'. 
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">WARNING</span>:
            because '\' is used as an 'escape' character in codes like '\n' and
            '\t', you need to use '\\' to insert a backslash into a string.

      <h2>Bonus Exercise: Complex shapes.</h2>
      <p> 
        If you were able to finish the previous exercises within lab time try
        to write some additional functions to print out more complex shapes. The
        shapes will require more thought, but the conditions are the same: no 
        <span class="codeword">if</span>s and use one or more nested loops for each.
        If you weren't able to get to these in the lab time, be sure to try
        them out on your own time to get some extra practice. In each case
        write a function in a script file that can be used to draw the
        designated shape, with a specified size and character.
