      <p><strong>Sep. 26 to 30, 2016</strong> </p>
      <h2>Material covered:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Loops and sums.</li>
        <li>Exploring precision.</li>
        <li>Data types.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
        Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.
      </p>

        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        The sequence of 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers">Fibonacci numbers</a> 
        is <span class="math">1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... <em>F<sub>n</sub></em></span>
        where the sequence starts with two 1s and every subsequent Fibonacci
        number is the sum of the previous two 
        (<span class="math"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub></span>
        = <span class="math"><em>F<sub>n</sub></em></span> + 
        <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub></span>;
        for example, 21 = 8 + 13). Sometimes 0 is included as the initial
        element: <span class="math"><em>F</em></span><sub>0</sub> = 0.
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        Write a program which uses a <span class="codeword">while</span>
        loop to calculate and print <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> and 
        <span class="math"><em>F<sub>n</sub></em></span>, as in the following sample
        output. Print all Fibonacci numbers less than 10<sup>30</sup>.
      </p>
      <div class="output">
      n  Fn
      1   1
      2   1
      3   2
      4   3
      5   5
      6   8
      7  13
      8  21
      9  34
     10  55

     12 144
     ...
     </div>
    <p>
      When you first try this task, coding the loop can be surprisingly
      tricky. Your loop will have to keep track of the previous <em>two</em>
      Fibonacci numbers in order to add them together. For this aim you may
      use some temporary variables to store the previous Fibonacci numbers in
      them. (It greatly simplifies the code if you use <em>tuple
      assignment</em>, where two assignments are done simultaneously. (We will
      discuss it in the class later).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the numbers you print become large enough to exceed the maximum
      possible integer value in other programming languages, and the maximum
      number of digits of precision possible with floats.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Exercise 2: Fibonacci Identities and Summing</h2>
    <p>
      Fibonacci numbers are fascinating to mathematicians and hobbyists because
      they have so many simple properties. For example, 
      <em>the sum of the first <span class="math">n</span> Fibonacci numbers
      is itself one less than <span class="math">F<sub>n+2</sub></span></em>.
      <span class="todo">To check this property, modify the code from Exercise 1
        to sum the Fibonacci numbers you calculate and print the total out too,
        like this (make sure to leave room to line up the columns):</span>
      </p>
    <div class="output"> 
    n Fn                  Sum of Fn
    1  1                     1
    2  1                     2
    3  2                     4
    4  3                     7
    5  5                    12
    6  8                    20
    7 13                    33
    8 21                    54 [one less than F<sub>10</sub>]
    9 34                    88
   10 55                   143
    ...
    </div>
    
    
    <h2>Exercise 3: Root Approximator</h2>
    <p>
      The Heron method for computing square roots starts with a guess and
      refines it. If <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> is a guess for the
      square root of <span class="math"><em>a</em></span>, then the average of
      <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and 
      <span class="math"><em>a/x</em></span> is a better guess. 
      <span class="todo">Write a loop that starts with a guess of 
      <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> is 1, and then calculates guesses
      (averages) until the difference between successive guesses is within
      10<sup>-6</sup>.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are confident that your loop works, <span class="todo"><em>nest
      it</em> within another loop that will print out the Heron-estimated
      square roots <strong>and</strong> the <code>math.sqrt</code> of the
      following values: 0.3, 0.5, 0.9, 1.7, 3.3, etc. up to 819.3</span> (start
      at 0.3, and add 0.2, then 0.4, then 0.8, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of the code should look something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      aa, diff = ?, ? <span class="comment"># number to find root of, and difference between numbers</span>
      <span class="keyword">while</span> aa &lt; <span class="literal">820</span> :
        xx = ?
        <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="builtin">abs</span>(...) &gt; <span class="literal">1.e-6</span> : 
          xx = ... <br>
        <span class="keyword">print</span> (<span class="string">"square root of ..."</span>
        diff = ? 
        aa = ?
    </div>
