        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Predict the output and <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span>.</h2>
      <p>
        Sample midterm tests have been posted on the main page of the COMP1012
        website. There are versions without answers to work through, and
        versions with answers to check.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first question on each sample midterm is of the type 
        <em>"Predict the output"</em>. Some sample code is given, and you must predict
        what the code will print. We find students do well on these questions
        when they practise with <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span>. To
        encourage you, at least three of the questions of this type on the
        midterm will be taken from <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we will have at least one question taken from 
        <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span> where you will be shown a
        mathematical expression and asked to give code for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you encounter any problems with <span class="codeword">QuizMaster7</span>,
        send an e-mail to your instructor. Feel free to examine the code and
        even suggest improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following sections discuss problems students might have with the
        different categories of questions, and how to resolve them.

      <h3>QUESTIONS ON SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS</h3>
      <div class="code"> 
<span class="blue">What is printed by

print (4**3 / 3 // 2)  ?</span> 

10.
<span class="blue">Correct!</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this section the questions involve small integers (and occasional
        floats) and the basic math operations: 
        <span class="codeword"> +, -, *, /, //, % </span> and 
        <span class="codeword">**</span>. There are no
        brackets, so you need to know the precedence with which these operators
        are evaluated. In brief, there are three rules, as covered by the
        acronym <b>BEDMAS</b> (meaning, <b>B</b>rackets,
        <b>E</b>xponentiation, <b>D</b>ivision and <b>M</b>ultiplication,
        <b>A</b>ddition and <b>S</b>ubtraction):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Evaluate powers (exponentiation) first, <i>right to left</i>.</em><br>
          That is, <span class="codeword">2**3**4</span> is the same as 
          <span class="codeword">2**(3**4)</span>, which is the huge number 
          <span class="codeword">2417851639229258349412352</span>,
          <b><i>NOT</i></b> <span class="codeword">(2**3)**4</span>, which
          yields <span class="codeword">8**4 = 4096</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Evaluate multiplications and division next, left to right.</em><br>
          So <span class="codeword">1 + 2 * 3 // 4 % 7</span> is the same as 
          <span class="codeword">1 + (((2 * 3) // 4) % 7)</span>, with the addition
          done last.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Evaluate additions and subtractions next, left to right.</em><br>
          The expression <span class="codeword">1 - 2 * 4 - 2**3 / 2</span> is
          done as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
              First the power, leaving <span class="codeword">1 - 2 * 4 - 8 / 2</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then the multiplications and divisions, left to right, leaving 
              <span class="codeword">1 - 8 - 4.0</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then the additions and subtractions left to right, giving 
              <span class="codeword">(1 - 8) - 4.0 = -11.0</span>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One additional consideration with the division operators is the
        possibility of dividing by 0. Python has a rule: you cannot follow 
        <span class="codeword">/, //</span> or <span class="codeword">%</span> by 
        <span class="codeword">0</span>. If that occurs, the answer will be an
        error, and you should enter <span class="codeword">Error</span> as your
        response. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the expression involves a <span class="codeword">float</span>
        constant (like <span class="codeword">5.</span>), then the final result
        of the expression will be <span class="codeword">float</span> as well.
        Enter the result with a decimal point. With regard to division, remember:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            that the <span class="codeword">//</span> operator <em>always</em>
            produces an integer value, but if one of the operands is float,
            the result will be of 
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;">type</span> 
            <span class="codeword">float</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            that the <span class="codeword">/</span> operator <em>always</em>
            produces a result of
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;">type</span> 
            <span class="codeword">float</span>, even if both of the operands are of
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;">type</span> 
            <span class="codeword">int</span>.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <em>The expression to code</em> is shown as a graphics file in
          another window. It is written out as a mathematical expression, and
          may involve functions as well as mathematical operations. If you can't
          get your computer to display the equation, try changing the default
          application your computer uses to open png files. If that doesn't
          work, try displaying graphics in the console (Tools - Preferences - 
          IPython console - Graphics tab - Graphics backend: Inline). 
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>The expression may involve variables</em> like <span class="math"><i>a</i>,
          <i>b</i>, <i>x</i> or <i>y</i></span>. In your code, use the
          doubled identifiers <span class="codeword">aa, bb, xx</span> and 
          <span class="codeword">yy</span> for these variables. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>All division is floating point.</em> In Python, the division
          <span class="codeword">-3/2</span> has the
          value <span class="math">-1.5</span>. It is helpful to replace all
          numbers by floats in your expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>It is OK to simplify.</em> The correct expression printed
          out by <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span> when you make a
          mistake is not simplified, but it is OK for you to enter a simplified
          expression, like <span class="codeword">(8.5 + math.floor(bb)) * 4.0</span>.
          Here <span class="codeword">(-3.)/2. + 10</span> has been replaced by
          <span class="codeword">8.5</span>, and 
          <span class="codeword">math.floor(4.)</span>
          has been replaced by <span class="codeword">4.0</span>. The original
          answer was marked wrong because integer division was assumed, and the
          <span class="codeword">math.floor</span> operation on 
          <span class="codeword">bb</span>
          was omitted, not because simplification was done.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Assume the math library is available.</em> Use functions
          from this library, except when they are not needed (e.g., 
          <span class="codeword">abs</span>
          should <emph>not</emph> be written as <span class="codeword">math.abs</span>.
          Absolute value is shown as <span class="math">|<i>b</i>|</span>, the
          floor operation is shown as 
          <span class="math">⌊<i>b</i>⌋</span> as above,
          and the ceiling operation is shown as

        <li>
          <em>The comparison is done on data values.</em> If you make a
          mistake, <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span> will show you the

        Python is unusual among computer languages in how it mixes 
        <i>relational operators</i> (
        <span class="codeword">&lt;, ≤, ==, !=, &gt; ≥</span>)
        and <i>logical operators</i> (<span class="codeword">and</span> and 
        <span class="codeword">or</span>). But once again there are a few rules.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Evaluate all the mathematical expressions first, as described
          above.</em> The expression 
          <span class="codeword">5 + 3 == 2 * 4 &gt; 3</span> is evaluated like 
          <span class="codeword">(5 + 3) == (2 * 4) &gt; 3</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Evaluate all comparisons left to right, and combine them with
          <span class="codeword builtin">and</span>.</em> So
          the expression above becomes <span class="codeword">8 == 8 &gt; 3</span>,
          which is evaluated as <span class="codeword">(8 == 8) 
          <span class="codeword builtin">and</span> (8 &gt; 3)</span>. 
          Since both comparisons yield <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>,
          the result is <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>. Few other 
          languages evaluate a sequence of comparisons this way. 
          Note that if the expression were 
          <span class="codeword">5 + 3 &lt; 2 * 4 &gt; 3</span> instead, it would
          simplify to <span class="codeword">8 &lt; 8 &gt; 3</span> and then to
          <span class="codeword">(8 &lt; 8) 
          <span class="codeword builtin">and</span> (8 &gt; 3)</span>. 
          In this case, the leftmost comparison <span class="codeword">8 &lt; 8</span> 
          is <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>,
          and we know right away it would make the chain of comparisons 
          <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>, and so Python 
          would not actually evaluate <span class="codeword">8 &gt; 3</span> 
          as its value is irrelevant. Sometimes not evaluating code in an
          expression has side-effects (e.g., a function does not get called to
          print out a value). That is why it is important to know that
          evaluation is left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Next evaluate <span class="codeword builtin">and</span>s left to right.</em>
          <div class="aside"> 
            You probably know the rule for evaluating 
            <span class="codeword">xx  <span class="builtin">and</span> yy</span> 
            when <span class="codeword">xx</span> and <span class="codeword">yy</span> 
            are both <span class="codeword builtin">bool</span>: 
            the result is <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span> if and only 
            if both <span class="codeword">xx</span> and <span class="codeword">yy</span> 
            are <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>. But what is the value
            of <span class="codeword">(5 <span class="builtin">and</span> 3)</span>? 
            Python has a more general definition of 
            <span class="codeword builtin">and</span> than most languages. First, the
            result of 
            <span class="codeword">xx <span class="builtin">and</span> yy</span> 
            is going to be one of the values <span class="codeword">xx</span>
            and <span class="codeword">yy</span>. 
            If they are both <span class="codeword builtin">bool</span>, the result 
            will be <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span> or it will be 
            <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>. If we evaluate 
            <span class="codeword">(5 <span class="builtin">and</span> 3)</span>, 
            the result will be either <span class="codeword">5</span> or it will be 
            <span class="codeword">3</span>. But which one? Python first evaluates the 
            <span class="codeword builtin">bool</span> value of the left side of the
            <span class="codeword builtin">and</span>; that is,
            <span class="codeword">bool(xx)</span>. (The 
            <span class="codeword builtin">bool</span> value of a non-zero number or a
            non-empty list or string is <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>.
            The <span class="codeword builtin">bool</span> value of zero or of an empty
            list or string is <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>.) 
            If that value is <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>,
            we know right away that <span class="codeword">
            <span class="builtin">bool</span>(xx <span class="builtin">and</span> yy)</span> 
            will be <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span>, so 
            <span class="codeword builtin">and</span>
            returns the value <span class="codeword">xx</span> (it could be 
            <span class="codeword truefalse">False</span> or 
            <span class="codeword">0</span>
            or an empty list, <span class="codeword">[]</span>, or an empty
            string <span class="codeword">""</span>, etc.). But if 
            <span class="codeword"><span class="builtin">bool</span>(xx)</span> is 
            <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>, we don't know the result, as it
            depends on <span class="codeword">yy</span>. So then 
            <span class="codeword builtin">and</span> returns the value of 
            <span class="codeword">yy</span>.
            As a function, <span class="codeword builtin">and</span>
            would work like this :<br>
            <div class="code"> 
<span class="definition">def</span> <span style="color: blue;">andFunction</span>(xx,yy):
  result = xx 
  <span style="color: green;">if </span> <span style="color: violet;">bool</span>(result):
    result = yy
  <span style="color: green;">return</span> result 
          </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Finally, evaluate <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">or</span>s
          left to right.</em> Like <span class="codeword">
          <span style="color:green;">and</span>, xx 
          <span style="color:green;">or</span> yy</span> returns either 
          <span class="codeword">xx</span> or it returns <span class="codeword">yy</span>.
          Can you figure out why the following 
          <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">or</span>
          function works? Once again remember that 
          <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">or</span>
          will evaluate <span class="codeword">yy</span>, the argument on the
          right, only if it has to.
          <div class="code"> 
<span class="definition">def</span> <span style="color: blue;">orFunction</span>(xx,yy):
  result = xx

        Putting all these rules together, why does the <span class="codeword">QuizMaster</span>
        expression at the beginning of this section work? The expression is 
        <span class="codeword">1 == 1 <span style="color:green;">and</span> 2 
        <span style="color:green;">or</span> 3</span>. There are no mathematical
        subexpressions, so we proceed to comparisons. 
        <span class="codeword">1 == 1</span> is 
        <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>,
        so it becomes <span class="codeword"><span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>
          <span style="color:green;">and</span> 2 <span style="color:green;">or</span>
          3</span>. The left side of the <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">and</span>
        is <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>, so 
        <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">and</span> returns the right side, 
        which is <span class="codeword">2</span>. We then have <span class="codeword">2 
        <span style="color:green;">or</span> 3</span>. The left side of 
        <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">or</span> has a boolean value of 
        <span class="codeword truefalse">True</span>, so 
        <span class="codeword" style="color:green;">or</span>
        returns the left side: <span class="codeword">2</span>. The answer that
        is printed is <span class="codeword">2</span>.

      <h3>QUESTIONS ON RANGE EXPRESSIONS</h3>
      <div class="code" style="color: blue"> 
What is printed by 
print range(5,3,-1) ? <span style="color: black">[5,4]</span>
Correct!
      </div>
      <p>
        The <span class="codeword">range</span> function returns a 
        <span class="codeword">list</span>
        of equally-spaced integer values. There are three variants, depending on
        whether you use 1, 2 or 3 integer arguments in your call. If there are
        no possible values, range will return an empty <span class="codeword">list</span>,
        represented by <span class="codeword">[]</span>.
        </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>3-argument variant: </em><span class="codeword">range(start, stop, step)</span>. 
          The parameter <span class="codeword">start</span>
          provides the first value that will appear in the <span class="codeword">list</span>,
          if any. Subsequent values will be 
          <span class="codeword">start + step, start + 2*step, start + 3*step,</span> etc. 
          If <span class="codeword">step &gt; 0</span>, the sequence will be increasing; 
          if <span class="codeword">step &lt; 0</span>, the sequence will be decreasing. 
          If <span class="codeword">step</span>
          is <span class="codeword">0</span>, <span class="codeword">range</span>
          will generate a <span class="codeword">ValueError</span> exception.
          The sequence always stops before reaching <span class="codeword">stop;</span>
          the <span class="codeword">stop</span> value will never appear in the
          <span class="codeword">list</span>. The <span class="codeword">list</span>
          will be empty in two cases: (a) <span class="codeword">start == stop,</span>
          and (b) <span class="codeword">stop - start</span> has the opposite
          sign from <span class="codeword">step.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>2-argument variant:</em> <span class="codeword">range(start, stop)</span>. 
          This is the same as the 3-argument variant, with an
          assumed <span class="codeword">step</span> of <span class="codeword">1.</span>
          The <span class="codeword">list</span> returned will be empty unless
          <span class="codeword">start &lt; stop.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>1-argument variant:</em> <span class="codeword">range(stop)</span>.
          This is the same as the 3-argument variant, with an assumed 
          <span class="codeword">start</span>
          of <span class="codeword">0</span> and <span class="codeword">step</span>
          of <span class="codeword">1.</span> The number of entries in the
          returned <span class="codeword">list</span> is the same as 
          <span class="codeword">stop.</span>
          For example, <span class="codeword">range(5)</span> gives 
          <span class="codeword">[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],</span> which has 5 entries.

      <h3>QUESTIONS ON SLICE EXPRESSIONS</h3>
      <div class="code" style="color: blue"> 
What is printed by
print ('alphabet'[1:3])   ? <span style="color: black">"lp"</span>
Correct!
      </div>
      <p>
        The slice operator (here <span class="codeword">[1:3]</span>) can be
        used to extract part of any sequence in Python, whether it is a 
        <span class="codeword">string</span>,
        a <span class="codeword">list</span>, a <span class="codeword">tuple</span>,
        and later a <span class="codeword">numpy array</span>�in fact, anything
        that can be subscripted. Here are the rules:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>The type doesn't change.</em> The result of the slice will
          be of the same type as the sequence you are slicing: a 
          <span class="codeword">list</span>
          yields a <span class="codeword">list</span> result, a 
          <span class="codeword">string</span>
          yields a <span class="codeword">string</span> result, and a 
          <span class="codeword">tuple</span>
          yields a <span class="codeword">tuple</span> result.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>The numbers in the slice brackets define a range of
          subscripts.</em> For example, if you take a slice 
          <span class="codeword">"martians"[3:6]</span>,
          you will get characters in positions defined by 
          <span class="codeword">range(3,6)</span>,
          namely positions <span class="codeword">[3, 4, 5]</span>, yielding 
          <span class="codeword">"tia"</span>. It is possible to add another part to
          the slice to provide a step, like <span class="codeword">"martians"[3:0:-1]</span>
          which gives <span class="codeword">"tra"</span>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Negative numbers have the sequence length added to them.</em>
          Negative entries in the slice (except in the last step part) are first
          converted by adding the length of the sequence before a range is
          generated. So <span class="codeword">"martians"[3:-1:-1]</span> is
          interpreted as <span class="codeword">"martians"[3:7:-1]</span> which
          is <span class="codeword">""</span>, and 
          <span class="codeword">"martians"[-5:-2]</span>
          is the same as <span class="codeword">"martians"[3:6]</span> which is
          <span class="codeword">"tia".</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
