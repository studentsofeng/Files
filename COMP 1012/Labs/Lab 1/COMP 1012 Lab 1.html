    <h1 style="font-size:20pt">COMP 1012 Lab 1</h1>
    <p><strong>September 12 to 16, 2016</strong> </p>

    <h2>Material covered:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Claimid and a small survey.</li>
      <li>Editing and running Python programs.</li>
      <li>Computing formulas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p> 
      All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
      Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.
    </p>
    <p> 
      If you have a laptop computer, and need help installing Anaconda Python
      and running programs with it, bring the laptop to the lab. The
      demonstrator may be able to help you, as time permits. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
      attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on. 
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise 1: Gaining Access to Lab Computers</h2>
    <p> 
      If you have not done so, you must claim your U of M computer account
      using Iridium. From a logged in computer (maybe this is a good time to
      meet the person sitting next to you in the lab!) open a web browser and
      go to <a href="http://iridium.umanitoba.ca/">http://iridium.umanitoba.ca</a>.
      Click on "<span class="codeword">Create UMnetID</span>". You will have
      to identify yourself, and then provide answers to a number of personal
      questions so that you can later log in even if your forget your
      password. Make sure you register for the <b><span class="codeword">INS</span></b>
      service. It enables you to access lab computers. Record your 
      <span class="codeword">UMnetID</span> and password or otherwise take
      steps to remember them. If you have already claimed your ID, you can
      also change your password or answers to security questions using 
      <a class="codeword" href="http://iridium.umanitoba.ca/">Iridium</a>. The
      same user <span class="codeword">UMnetID</span> will be used to log into
      the course UM Learn website. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The login procedure for the lab computers has changed this year for
      students. To login, you must enter your <em>complete U of M email
      address</em>. Your email address is composed of: your <em>UMnetID</em>,
      followed by the <em>@</em> symbol, and then <em>myumanitoba.ca</em>. For example,
      a student with UMnetID of chan139, the U of M email address is:
      <em>chan139@myumanitoba.ca</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise 2: Ensuring that Python works on your lab computer</h2>
    <p>
      For this course we are using <span class="codeword">Anaconda 
      Python</span>. You can acquire it for your personal computer from 
      <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">this link</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on the <span class="codeword">Start</span> button, choose 
      <span class="codeword">INS Programs</span>, and then 
      <span class="codeword">Programming</span>. In the 
      <span class="codeword">Programming</span> sub-menu, you should see 
      <span class="codeword" "="">Spyder (Python IDE)</span>. 
      Click on it to start the Spyder IDE.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Exercise 3: An introductory survey</h2>
    <p> 
      Please spend a few minutes answering some questions about yourself
      (anonymously) by filling out and submitting 
      <a href="https://universityofmanitoba.desire2learn.com/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=235692&amp;type=survey&amp;rCode=UManitoba-347728">
      this Survey</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise 4: Running programs from class</h2>
    <p> 
      The Week 1 class notes are available as a 
      <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~comp1012/2016C/1012_2016C_Week_01_v1.pdf">
      pdf file on the course website</a>. Try one of the computation exercises 
      <em>described in those notes:</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>estimate the volume of the <em>Great Pyramid of Ghiza</em>;</li>
      <li>estimate the <em>force of a jet of water on a plate</em>;</li>
    </ul>
    <p> With these problems, try the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        evaluate some of the formulas shown in <em>interactive mode</em>
        (in the IPython console window), line by line, to see what the
        interface does;
      </li>
      <li>
        write instructions for each problem in a <em> separate script
        file</em> (edit it in the left window and save it with a file name
        that ends with <span class="codeword">".py"</span>), and run the file
        (green triangle icon), fixing any errors that are detected so that it
        produces the right results;
      </li>
      <li>
        write the code on your own without referring to the solutions in the
        notes, and check those solutions to <em>compare with your results;</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>modify the data</em> to solve similar but different
        problems, and <em>modify the output statements</em> to make the
        output you would like to see.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
      Add comment lines similar to the following to the beginning of your
      script files. We will require documentation of this type in all your
      assignments. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Save the file to the <span class="codeword">H:</span> (Home) drive on
      your lab computer if you can; otherwise use the desktop or a USB drive.
      You may have material stored on the "old" <span class="codeword">H:</span> drive
      if this isn't your first year as a student. You will see instructions on
      the computer Desktop about retrieving that material and moving it to the
      "new" <span class="codeword">H:</span> drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desktop on a lab computer is stored on the computer itself, not on
      your network drive, so you should copy your files to a more permanent
      location before you leave. A good approach is to carry a thumb drive and
      plug it into the lab computer, using it to store your programs. Remember
      to take it with you!
