      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda

      <p>
        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Flight of an arrow</h2>
      <img src="./COMP 1012 Lab 2_files/ArrowTrajectory.png">
      <p>
        You shoot an arrow upwards; <span class="todo">Print
        out its horizontal and vertical position every second until it hits
        the earth.</span> 
      </p>
      <p>Here are the details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is shot at a 45° angle from horizontal when it leaves the bow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Its initial speed is 60 m/s. That means its horizontal velocity is
          <i>V<sub>x</sub></i> = 60 cos(45°) m/s and its vertical velocity
          is <i>V<sub>y</sub></i> = 60 sin(45°) m/s. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume that the horizontal velocity remains unchanged, so its
          horizontal distance after <i>t</i> seconds is <i>x<sub>t</sub></i> =
          <i>V<sub>x</sub>t</i> m.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gravity affects its vertical path. The acceleration due to gravity
          is <i>g</i> = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Consequently the arrow's height
          after <i>t</i> seconds is <i>y<sub>t</sub></i> = 1.5 + <i>V<sub>y</sub>t</i>
          - 0.5<i>gt</i><sup>2</sup> m (assuming it was 1.5 m high when
          released). When the height is 0 or less, the arrow has landed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Neglect the effects of air resistance. Because of the shape of the
          arrow, air resistance does not have a large effect, in comparison with
          say a cannon ball or a golf ball with the same starting trajectory.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use <span class="codeword">math.cos(angle)</span> and 
          <span class="codeword">math.sin(angle)</span> from the 
          <span class="codeword">math</span> library, but these functions
          require an angle in radians. To convert from <i>d</i> degrees to
          <i>r</i> radians, use this formula: <i>r</i> = π × <i>d</i>
          / 180. You can get π from <span class="codeword">math.pi</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do this part <span class="em">without using a while loop</span>; you
          may copy and paste the code you write for each time step to make
          code for the next time step.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Typical output might look like the following:</p>
      <div class="output">
The arrow has speed 60 m/s and rises at a 45 degree angle
At time 0.0 s the arrow is at position ( 0.0 ,  1.5 ) m
At time 1.0 s the arrow is at position ( 42.42640687119285 ,  39.021406871192845 ) m
At time 2.0 s the arrow is at position ( 84.8528137423857 ,  66.73281374238569 ) m
At time 3.0 s the arrow is at position ( 127.27922061357856 ,  84.63422061357853 ) m
At time 4.0 s the arrow is at position ( 169.7056274847714 ,  92.72562748477138 ) m
At time 5.0 s the arrow is at position ( 212.13203435596427 ,  91.00703435596422 ) m
At time 6.0 s the arrow is at position ( 254.55844122715712 ,  79.47844122715708 ) m
At time 7.0 s the arrow is at position ( 296.98484809834997 ,  58.139848098349916 ) m
At time 8.0 s the arrow is at position ( 339.4112549695428 ,  26.99125496954275 ) m
At time 9.0 s the arrow is at position ( 381.8376618407357 ,  -13.967338159264415 ) m

      <h2>Exercise 2: Controlling precision</h2>
      <p>
        You may have noticed that the values you calculate have varying
        precision-that is, the number of digits used to write the number. Some
        numbers are displayed with 15 digits, some with 16, and some with 17.
        The precision of numbers in a Python program can be
        controlled at either the time when the value is stored, or when it is
        displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To control the number of digits actually <strong><em>stored</em></strong>,
        you can use the conversions below. We normally do this only in special
        cases, such as when dealing with currency calculations, where we round
        numbers to the nearest penny (2 decimal places).
      </p>
      <p class="code">
Assume xx has a float value.
  <span class="builtin">int</span>(xx) gives the integer part of the value xx, with the decimal part removed.
  <span class="builtin">int</span>(<span class="literal">5.76</span>) → 5
  <span class="builtin">int</span>(-<span class="literal">5.76</span>) → -5
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(xx,nn) gives xx rounded to the nearest number with nn decimal places; 
If you leave out nn, the default value is 0, and result is an int. If nn is given, a float is returned.
Values that end in <span class="codeword">.5</span> are a special case; Python uses <em>round half to even</em>,
which means the value is rounded to the nearest <em>even</em> number.
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">5.76</span>) → 6   <span class="comment"># calling round with one argument returns an int</span>
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">5.76</span>,<span class="literal">0</span>) → 6.0   <span class="comment"># calling round with two arguments returns a float</span>
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">5.76</span>,<span class="literal">1</span>) → 5.8
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">5.76</span>,-<span class="literal">1</span>) → 10.0
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">8.5</span>) → 8   <span class="comment"># round half to even rounds down in this case</span>
  <span class="builtin">round</span>(<span class="literal">5.5</span>) → 6   <span class="comment"># round half to even rounds up in this case</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        To control the way a number is <em>displayed</em> as a string, use
        format conversions. These conversions produce a string containing the
        number suitably formatted. The <span class="codeword">%d</span> format
        conversion displays a number as an integer, such as <span class="codeword literal">"123"</span>. The <span class="codeword">%f</span>
        format shows decimal fractions (e.g., <span class="codeword literal">"12.3"</span>). The <span class="codeword">%e</span>
        format uses scientific notation (like <span class="codeword literal">"1.23e-17"</span>, which means the same as 1.23 ×
        10<sup>-17</sup>). The <span class="codeword">%g</span> format
        conversion is a convenient way to display a number with a minimum
        number of digits (e.g., 
        <span class="codeword">"%g" % <span class="literal">6.0</span></span>
        appears as <span class="codeword">"<span class="literal">6</span>"</span> and 
        <span class="codeword">"%g" % <span class="literal">0.00000017</span></span> gives 
        <span class="codeword">"<span class="literal">1.7e-7</span>"</span>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, you can use width specifiers between the 
        <span class="codeword">%</span> and the format code to determine how wide a
        field will be. Here are some examples, using vertical bars to show
        which characters are the result of the format code:
      </p>
      <p class="code"> 
<span class="string">"|%g|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|163.789|'</span>
<span class="string">"|%f|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|163.789010|'</span>
<span class="string">"|%e|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|1.637890e+02|'</span>
<span class="string">"|%d|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|163|'</span> <span class="comment"># note there is no rounding</span>
<span class="string">"|%8.3g|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|     164|'</span> <span class="comment"># field of width 8, with 3 digits</span>
<span class="string">"|%8.3f|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'| 163.789|'</span> <span class="comment"># field of width 8, with 3 decimal places</span>
<span class="string">"|%8.2e|"</span> % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|1.64e+02|'</span> <span class="comment"># field of width 8, with 2 decimal places</span>
<span class="string">"|%8d|"</span>   % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|     163|'</span> <span class="comment"># field of width 8</span>
<span class="string">"|%2d|"</span>   % <span class="literal">163.78901</span> → <span class="string">'|163|'</span> <span class="comment"># if a number won't fit, the field size is expanded</span> 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Notice that <span class="codeword">g</span>, 
        <span class="codeword">f</span> and <span class="codeword">e</span>
        conversions automatically <em>round the last digit shown</em> when
        other digits are not shown. In contrast, the 
        <span class="codeword">d</span> conversion simply <em>truncates digits</em>
        after the decimal point, with no rounding. 
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        Modify your solution to Exercise 2 to line up the output in neat
        columns, so that all decimal points and the number of digits after the
        decimal points line up vertically. You may use a loop here. Your
        output should show a number of decimal places that represents the
        accuracy of your values. Try it once with decimal notation, and again
        with scientific notation. Then, try it again, showing only (truncated)
        integers in neat columns. How would you get rounded integers? 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Exercise 3: Using Random Numbers to Estimate π</h2>
      <p> 
        Random numbers are used frequently in the real world: lotteries
        (randomly selected numbers), board games (rolling a die), or card
        games (shuffled decks of cards). Without random numbers these games
        would not be very interesting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Random numbers can be simulated on a computer using a
        <strong>pseudo-random generator</strong>. For example, if you 
        <span class="codeword">import random</span> into your script, a call to
        <span class="codeword">random.random()</span> returns a float between
        0 and 1, where every 16-digit decimal fraction in this interval is
        equally likely to occur. Note that the upper bound 1 is guaranteed
        never to occur, although you could get 0.999999999999999.
      </p>
      <div class="aside"> 
        Pseudo-random numbers are a little different from 
        <em>truly random</em> numbers. If you have time some extra time at 
        the end of the lab take a look at the 
        <a href="http://www.random.org/">http://www.random.org</a> website for
        more information about the difference between pseudo-random and truly
        random numbers. 
      </div>
      <p> 
        <span class="todo">Create a new script that uses a 
        <span class="codeword">while</span>
        loop to generate a sequence of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values
        between 0 and 1. </span>Assume that <em>x</em> is the horizontal
        position and <em>y</em> is the vertical position of a dart thrown at
        the top right corner of a square 'dartboard' (see figure below).
      </p>
      <img src="./COMP 1012 Lab 2_files/EstimatePi.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="200">
      <p>
        The circle shown has a radius of 1.0 units, and so the whole circle has
        an area of π square units. This corner of the circle has an area of π/4
        square units (approximately equal to 0.785 square units). The area of
        the square shown is 1.0 square units. So a random point in the square
        has about a 78.5% probability of landing inside the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we generate 100 points, and 77 of them fall inside the circle, then
        our estimate of π is 4.0 * 77 / 100 = 3.08. If we generate 1000 points
        and 791 of them fall inside the circle, our estimate of π is 4.0 * 791 /
        1000 = 3.164. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we count how many points are inside the circle? Use a 
        <span class="codeword">while</span>
        loop to generate each <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> point with 
        <span class="codeword">random.random</span>.
        Inside the loop, for each (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) point calculate <em>p</em>
        = (<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 1). This 
        <span class="codeword">boolean</span> value is either 
        <span class="codeword">True</span>
        or <span class="codeword">False</span>, indicating whether (<em>x</em>,
        <em>y</em>) is inside the circle or not. Add the value <em>p</em> to a
        total for each point. The value <span class="codeword">True</span> will
        add 1 to the total, and <span class="codeword">False</span> will add 0,
        because Python automatically converts their values if a number is
        needed. As a result, the total will count the number of random points
        inside the circle.
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        First set the <span class="codeword">while</span> loop to generate
        1000 values and see what kind of estimate you print out. Can you
        change the while loop to keep working until you repeatedly get a π
        estimate between 3.1410 and 3.1420? How many points does that take?
        Run your script several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example in the Week 2 notes shows you how to estimate π using a
        power series. That approach is much more accurate and uses far fewer
        computations than this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just for information, the code used to generate the plot is shown
        below. Do not expect to understand all of it yet. It is often handy to
        be able to plot the data you generate, as we shall see later in the
        course.
