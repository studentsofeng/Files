        You can make up for a lab you have missed or will miss. Even if you
        are not planning on missing any labs.
      </div>
      
      <h2>Material covered:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Exam Prep 
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
        Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Writing code by hand.</h2>
      <p>
        One of the challenges of writing a test in COMP 1012 is writing code 
        by hand.  In this question, you should write a programming question 
        by hand, then enter the code into spyder and try to see how you can 
        improve it. 
      </p>
    
<p>
Look at the <a href="http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~comp1012/Finals/final_1012_2013A_v4.pdf">Winter 2013 final exam</a>, Question B.3 (Page 5 of 13). 
<b>You should use math.cos</b> in your solution (unlike what the question
asks).
</p>

<p>
Write the solution for the pendulum function on paper. Once you have completed
it, type it in exactly as you have it into spyder to verify your solution. 
</p>

<p>
To test your answer, call the pendulum method with g = 9.8, initial angle
math.pi/6 and radius 0.3 m. You should get values of approximately
1.1 s and 0.89 m/s.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Finding Errors </h2>

<p> 
When reviewing your written code, it is helpful to be able to detect
small errors that can cause problems with your code. In this part of the lab,
you will look at a written solution and identify problems with the code.
For more detail on this question, consult the <a href="http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~comp1012/Finals/final_1012_2013C_v1_WA.pdf">Fall 2013 Exam</a> (Part D).

</p>

<div class="code">
def showWord(word, guessed)
  """Create a string showing the word double-spaced,
  with unguessed letters represented by underscores"""
  display = ''
  for letter in guessed:
    if letter in guessed:
       display += letter + ' '
    else :
       display = "_ " 
  return letter

word = input("Enter a word: ")
letters, guessed = word, '', 3
while len(letters)&gt;0:
  guessed = guessed + letters[0]
  letters = letters.replace(letters[0] : '')
  print(showWord(word, guessed))
  
</div>

<p>This question was part of an assignment during that term, so
it's ok if you don't understand it quickly. It formed part of a guessing game
like hangman:
</p><ul>
<li>The function <span class="codeword">showWord</span> takes as parameters the target word ("BANANAS") 
and a list of guessed letters, and shows guessed letters in the word, 
but shows unguessed letters as an underscore</li>
<li>The functions works by looping through all letters in the word and building
a word <span class="codeword">display</span> that has letters and underscores in it.</li>
<li>Each letter is separated from each other letter by a space in <span class="codeword">showWord</span>.</li>
<li>The main code (lines 9-14) prompts the user for a word. Initially
it sets the letters in the word to all of the string word, and the guessed
letters to no letters.</li> 
<li>You can read about the replace method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html">here</a> (look for str.replace)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>So on input BANANAS, the output should be
</p><div class="code">
B _ _ _ _ _ _
B A _ A _ A _  
B A N A N A _  
B A N A N A S  
</div>
<p></p>

<p>Now that you understand the code, there are six errors in the code. List
them all and show how to fix them. Once you have found them all (or cannot find any more) enter your solution into spyder and try to run your code
as corrected.</p>
<p></p> 

<h2>Exercise 3: Coding Bat  </h2>

<p> 
Try <a href="http://codingbat.com/prob/p184853">this exercise</a> at
codingbat.com. Break the larger problem into smaller tasks that you can
solve with one construct like an if statement or loop.  Then build your 
larger solution.
