      <p><strong>Oct. 17 - 21, 2016</strong> </p>
      <h2>Material covered:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lists and tuples.</li>
        <li>Lists and loops.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
        Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.
      </p>

      <h2>Exercise 1: Tuple warm-up</h2>
      <p> 
        Write a script that will perform some simple manipulations on tuples.
        In this program, they will be used to represent points and vectors in
        two-dimensional space. Write just enough code for each step, and run
        your script after each. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Create two tuples representing points in a planeâ€”
          <span class="codeword">A:(3.5,1.2)</span>
          and <span class="codeword">B:(-2.7,-3.2)</span>. Print them. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Create another tuple representing a vector from <span class="codeword">A</span>
          to <span class="codeword">B</span> (that is, <span class="codeword">B-A</span>).
          Notice you can't just subtract one from the other; tuples don't
          support subtraction. Perform the subtraction one coordinate at a time
          by subscripting in the original tuples. Print the vector. What is
          wrong with the following code, if <span class="codeword">ptBminusA</span>
          is the difference vector tuple? Hint: how are tuples used with the
          format operator % ?
          <div class="code"><span class="keyword">print</span> (<span class="string">"ptB - ptA: %s"</span> % ptBminusA)</div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          Create another tuple representing a point 
          <span class="codeword">C:(4.2, 2.8)</span>, and a tuple for the vector 
          <span class="codeword">C-B</span>.
          Print the points and vector. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate and print the sum of the two difference vectors 
          <span class="codeword">(C-B) + (B-A)</span> by adding their 
          corresponding elements. Calculate and print the vector difference
          <span class="codeword">C-A</span>. Are these two the same?
          Test their equality using the <span class="codeword">==</span>
          operator. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Calculate and print the length of the vector 
          <span class="codeword">(C-A) - ((C-B) + (B-A))</span> 
          using the standard distance formula (square
          root of the sum of the squares of the elements). Is it less than 0.00001? 
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      
      <h2>Exercise 2: List warm-up</h2>
      <p> 
        Write a program that will create and manipulate some simple lists of
        sequences. Write just enough code for each step, and run your program
        after each. Note: the range function behaves as follows: 
      </p>
      <div class="code">
<span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(7)) gives [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
<span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(12, 16)) gives [12, 13, 14, 15] 
<span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(12, 24, 3)) gives [12, 15, 18, 21] 
<span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(17, 8, -3)) gives [17, 14, 11] 
Slice: <span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(11,17)[0:1]) gives [11]
Slice: <span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(11,17)[1 : 4]) gives [12, 13, 14] 
Slice: <span class="function">list</span>(<span class="function">range</span>(11,17)[1 : 5 : 2]) gives [12, 14] 
</div>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Create a list <span class="codeword">U</span> containing the
          values <span class="codeword">[6, 5, 4]</span>. Print it. Why does
          the following code work when the sample code above did not (where 
          <span class="codeword">listU</span> is the list you created)? 
        </li>
        <div class="code"> <span class="keyword">print</span> (<span class="string">"listU: %s"</span> % listU) </div>
        <li> 
          Create another list <span class="codeword">V</span> containing the
          values <span class="codeword">[1, 2, 3]</span>. Subtract each element
          in the list from the corresponding element of <span class="codeword">U</span>
          to generate a list containing <span class="codeword">[5, 3, 1]</span>.
          You do not need to use a loop (yet). Note that you should <em>change</em>
          list <span class="codeword">V</span>, <em>not</em>
          create a new list. Changing a list like this is something you could
          not do with tuples. Print the list. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Create list <span class="codeword">W</span> using the builtin
          functions <span class="codeword builtin">list</span> and 
          <span class="codeword builtin">range</span>;
          <span class="codeword">W</span>
          should contain the <em>first ten positive odd</em>
          numbers. Print the list. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Create a list <span class="codeword">X</span> with 
          <span class="codeword builtin">list</span>
          and <span class="codeword builtin">range</span>
          that starts with the second last value of the previous list (get that
          value using a subscript) and counts by odd numbers down to 7
          (inclusive). Print the list. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Concatenate the lists <span class="codeword">W</span>, 
          <span class="codeword">X</span>
          and <span class="codeword">V</span> (in that order) to make a new
          list <span class="codeword">Y</span> that counts odd numbers up and
          back down again. Print the resulting list, and its length. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Print a slice of <span class="codeword">Y</span> containing the 5
          middle values; that is, the slice contains the largest number in the
          list and the two values before and after it. <em>Hint</em>: use
          floor division to calculate the index of the middle value.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Print a slice of <span class="codeword">Y</span> containing every
          second odd number starting from 3 (3, 7, 11, etc.) up to the largest
          such value. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        As an additional exercise (on your own time), create a constant called
        <span class="codeword">HALFCOUNT</span> that contains the number 10,
        indicating the number of values to go in <span class="codeword">W</span>.
        Modify your subsequent steps so that a single change to this constant
        changes the results of all those steps to match (e.g. if 
        <span class="codeword">HALFCOUNT == 5</span> then you will get 
        <span class="codeword">[1,3,5,7,9,7,5,3,1]</span>
        in step 5).
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Exercise 3: Creating lists with a while loop</h2>
      <p> 
        Use either one or two <span class="codeword">while</span> loops to
        generate the same list that you produced in step 5 of the previous
        exercise (odd numbers counting up and down) by counting through the
        values; use <span class="codeword">listY.append</span> to add each
        value to the end. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Try to do it with a single loop. To make a single loop count up and
        then down, use a boolean variable called
        <span class="codeword">increasing</span>.
        Each time through the loop, set <span class="codeword">increasing</span>
        to <span class="codeword">True</span> if you have fewer than 
        <span class="codeword">10</span>
        (or <span class="codeword">HALFCOUNT</span>) entries, and 
        <span class="codeword">False</span>
        thereafter. Rely on the knowledge that <span class="codeword">True</span>
        is an alias for <span class="codeword">1</span> and 
        <span class="codeword">False</span>
        is equivalent to <span class="codeword">0</span> to come up with
        expressions that will either increase or decrease the loop counter. If
        you know what an "<span class="codeword">if</span> statement" is, do 
        <em>not</em> use it! <em>Hint</em>: you could use a short list of
        possible increments, or you could use a power (and many other
        expressions). 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Print your list after it has been generated. 
      </p>
