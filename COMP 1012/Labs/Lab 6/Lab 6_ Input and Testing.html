        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.

      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Read in an int, a float, and a tuple</h2>
      <p class="todo">
        Using three different <span class="codeword">input</span> commands and
        suitable prompt messages, read in a person's age, their height in
        metres, and their name. Then print out a message with the age, the
        height in centimetres, and the first name.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Here is a sample interaction. Notice how important it is to use a good
        prompt message so that the user will know what to enter.
      </p>
      <div class="output blue"> 
Enter your age in years: <span class="blk">20</span>
Enter your height in metres: <span class="blk">1.49</span>
Enter your name ('last name', 'first name'): <span class="blk">'Preston', 'Tamara'</span>

Hello, Tamara; you are 20 years old and 149 cm tall 
      </div>
      <p> 
        In each input you will read in a character string (that's all that 
        <span class="codeword">input</span> provides). You will need to convert
        it to the appropriate value. For example, this is how you could code the
        age input: 
      </p>
      <div class="code">
userInput = <span class="builtin">input</span>(<span class="string">"Enter your age in years: "</span>)
age = <span class="builtin">int</span>(userInput.strip())
      </div>
      <p>
        The function <span class="codeword">int</span> converts a string to an
        integer if it is possible. If not, it produces an exception. 
        (Will <span class="codeword">int</span> work on 
        <span class="codeword">"6.2"</span>?)
        The <em>method</em> <span class="codeword">strip</span> (a method
        is a function that appears after a dot after an identifier) removes
        extra blanks, tabs and newlines from the front and back of the string.
        It is not always needed, but it is a good practice to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering the height in metres requires a <span class="codeword">float</span>
        conversion. Entering a name as shown requires an evaluation of the input
        as an expression using the function <span class="codeword">eval</span>,
        as in:
      </p>
      <div class="code"> 
nameTuple = <span class="builtin">eval</span>(<span class="string">"'Preston', 'Tamara'"</span>)
      </div>
      <p>
        In some contexts, using eval can be quite risky, as discussed at 
        <a href="http://lybniz2.sourceforge.net/safeeval.html">
        lybniz2.sourceforge.net/safeeval.html</a>. An attacker can execute
        code that could damage your computer. But it can be made safer by using
        two optional arguments that limit what libraries and functions the code
        to be evaluated can use. The empty curly brackets shown below specify
        that no libraries nor function can be called in the evaluation.
      </p>
      <div class="code"> 
nameTuple = <span class="builtin">eval</span>(<span class="string">"'Preston', 'Tamara'"</span>, {}, {})
      </div>
      <p>
        If you are careful to limit the scope of the 
        <span class="codeword builtin">eval</span> statement in this way, you can
        use it to interpret user input that could be executed as an expression. But
        a clever hacker could still cause damage to your computer using more
        sophisticated approaches, as discussed at 
        <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html">
        http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        How would you make the following input work without using 
        <span class="codeword builtin">eval</span>?
      </p>
      <div class="output blue"> 
Enter your age in years: <span class="blk">20</span>
Enter your height in metres: <span class="blk">1.49 </span>
Enter your name (example: John Doe): <span class="blk">Tamara Preston</span>

Hello, Tamara; you are 20 years old and 149 cm tall 
      </div>
      <p>
        Hint: type <span class="codeword">help(str.split)</span> in the Console.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>
        Exercise 2: Avoiding invalid inputs: the <span class="codeword">assert</span>
        statement
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you prompt for an age as in Exercise 1, and the user gives you an
        invalid response like 
        <span class="codeword quote">"None of your business!"</span>, the 
        <span class="codeword">int</span>
        conversion will fail and the code will stop. Having the code fail right
        away on bad inputs is called <em>fail fast</em>, and it is a simple
        way of letting the user know that this input is unacceptable (though the
        result is not very elegant.)
      </p>
      <div class="aside"> 
        Type <span class="codeword">import this</span> in the Console
        to see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Zen of Python</span>. 
        Remember these lines: <br>
        <br>
        <span class="codeword">Errors should never pass silently. <br>
          Unless explicitly silenced. </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        What happens if the user enters a ridiculous result for age, like 
        <span class="codeword">-23</span> or <span class="codeword">7654321</span>
        (their student number)? Since these are valid integers, the code does
        not fail, and so it can continue to try to work with invalid data,
        perhaps failing eventually in a distant part of the code. <em>Input
        checking</em> is the process of finding invalid inputs of this type,
        and preventing the code from continuing. It can be a long and
        painstaking process to do a complete check, especially if the user's
        entries are not mistakes, but malicious attacks. Vulnerabilities in
        commercial code you read about are often failures of input checking that
        have been found and exploited by hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest way of preventing invalid inputs from entering your code
        is with an <span class="codeword">assert</span> statement. An 
        <span class="codeword">assert</span>
        statement contains a <span class="codeword">bool</span>ean expression,
        and it causes an exception if the <span class="codeword">bool</span>ean
        expression evaluates to <span class="codeword">False</span>. It is a
        way of implementing fail fast on value errors. Here's an example of an
        assertion being used to check on age. The string after the comma can be
        used to describe the problem.
      </p>
      <div class="code"> 
userInput = <span class="builtin">input</span>(<span class="string">"Enter your age in years: "</span>)
age = <span class="builtin">int</span>(userInput.strip())
<span class="keyword">assert</span> <span class="literal">0</span> &lt;= age &lt; <span class="literal">130</span> <span class="comment"># short form, or add an error message, as follows </span>
<span class="keyword">assert</span> <span class="literal">0</span> &lt;= age &lt; <span class="literal">130</span>, <span class="string">"Age %d is out of range 0 to 130"</span> % age 
      </div>
      <p class="blue">
        Add <span class="codeword">assert</span> statements
        to the code you developed in Exercise 1 using 
        <span class="builtin codeword"> eval</span> to ensure that age lies
        between 0 and 130 (what is the world record for age?), height lies
        beween 0.3 and 3.0, and that the name is of type <span class="codeword">tuple</span>
        (that is, <span class="codeword">type(name) == tuple</span>). Check its
        length to be more than 1, and that the <span class="codeword">type</span>
        of the first two entries is each <span class="codeword">str</span>. Try
        some test cases to make sure your assertions work. 
        <span class="blk">Note: no <span class="codeword">if</span> statements are 
        required; if an assertion fails, the code crashes.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Exercise 3: Looping for valid inputs</h2>
      <p>
        A more user-friendly way of dealing with invalid inputs is to do the
        following steps: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>detect the invalid input;</li>
        <li>let the user know what he did wrong and how to correct it;</li>
        <li>give the user another chance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">Rewrite the code from Exercise 3 to help the
          user enter a valid age. If his entry is invalid, give him a warning
          message and ask him again. The warning message should include the
          incorrect entry for feedback to the user. Keep repeating the process
          until his entry is acceptable.</span> Try to code the process
        yourself. It is surprisingly tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have troubles, consider the following example, where the object
        is to enter a string of at least 5 characters that begins with a letter.
        When more tests are needed, add in more independent tests, or use
        mutually exclusive tests using an 
        <span class="codeword">if ... elif ... elif ... else ...</span> clause.
      </p>
      <div class="code"> 
PROMPT = <span class="string">"Enter at least 5 characters, starting with a letter"</span>
warning = <span class="string">"\n"</span>
<span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="builtin">len</span>(warning) &gt; <span class="literal">0</span> : <span class="comment"># or just 'while warning :'</span>
  <span class="comment"># warning describes what was wrong last time </span>
  userText = <span class="builtin">input</span>(warning + PROMPT)
  warning = <span class="string">""</span>
  <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="builtin">len</span>(userText) &lt; <span class="literal">5</span> :
    warning += (<span class="string">"'"</span> + userText + <span class="string">"' has &lt; 5 characters\n"</span>)
  <span class="keyword">if not</span> (<span class="string">'a'</span> &lt;= userText.<span class="builtin">lower</span>() &lt;= <span class="string">'z'</span>) :
    warning += (<span class="string">"'"</span> + userText + <span class="string">"' does not start with a letter\n"</span>)
      </div>
      <p>
        How could you modify your code so it prompts the user a maximum of
        three times, and then quits if he still doesn't get it right?
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Exercise 4: The try ... except ... approach</h2>
      <p>
        This option is not required for the course, but it is handy to know. If
        you try any tricky code that might fail with an exception, you can catch
        the exception and deal with it. This approach is called <em>exception
        handling</em>, and it is expected with commercial code. In the
        following case, the <span class="codeword">try</span> part is executed.
        If it encounters an exception, instead of failing right away, it
        executes the <span class="codeword">except</span> part. This code can
        fail gracefully, or fix up the problem. By using this approach, the
        programmer can avoid testing for a number of conditions that will all
        cause the code to fail. It is then much easier to read the intent of the
        code by reading the <span class="codeword">try</span> part.
      </p>
      <div class="code"> 
<span class="codeword">try</span> :
  userInput = <span class="builtin">input</span>(<span class="string">"Enter your age in years: "</span>)
  age = <span class="builtin">int</span>(userInput.<span class="builtin">strip</span>())
<span class="codeword">except</span> :
  print <span class="string">"Invalid age '%s' entered"</span> % userInput
  age = <span class="literal">130</span>
      </div>
      <p class="todo">
        Try putting a <span class="codeword">try</span>
        clause around the solution to Exercise 1, and printing a suitable error
        message in the <span class="codeword">except</span> part.
      </p>
